    This app was trained using a Logistic Regression model, one of the simplest yet effective machine learning models for classification tasks. 
    The model was trained on a large dataset of hotel reviews, which were preprocessed and transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer. 
    This allows the model to understand the semantic meaning of the words in the review, and predict whether the review is positive (satisfied) or negative (unsatisfied). 
    Please note that the model might not always be 100% accurate, and should be used as a guide rather than a definitive judgment.

        - **1. Stay calm and professional:** When responding to a negative review, maintain a professional tone. It's crucial not to appear defensive or dismissive of the customer's concerns.
        - **2. Acknowledge the issue:** Show your customers that you value their feedback by acknowledging their concerns. This first step is crucial in showing that you take customer service seriously.
        - **3. Apologize and empathize:** Provide a sincere apology for any inconvenience the customer has experienced. Demonstrate empathy and understanding for their dissatisfaction.
        - **4. Offer a solution:** After acknowledging the issue, offer a concrete solution. This could be a refund, a replacement, or any other appropriate response to address the issue.
        - **5. Take the conversation offline:** If the issue needs a deeper discussion, suggest moving the conversation to a private channel. This can provide a space for a more detailed conversation, without airing all the specifics publicly.
        - **6. Follow up:** Once the issue has been resolved, follow up with the customer to ensure they're satisfied with the solution provided.
        - **7. Learn from the feedback:** Use negative reviews as an opportunity for improvement. Assess the feedback objectively and use it to make improvements in your services.
